Expenses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An employee reports expenses. Expenses occur on a date and belong to some 
expense category. Expenses have a memo field describing the specific expense. 
Expenses are initially just recorded, and must be explicitly submitted. 
Once submitted, an expense can be approved, denied, or sent back for review 
and later be resubmitted. One must be able to find:

* all expenses submitted, approved and rejected for an employee.
* all expenses for a category
* all expenses for a given period

ShipIt
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users can be either committers or reporters. Anyone can report and comment on issues. 
Committers can take over issues, resolve, assign them to other committers.

PetStore
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The traditional Pet Store application.

CarServ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application reverse engineered from the CarServ sample application that appears in the book 
`Domain-Driven Design Using Naked Objects <http://pragprog.com/book/dhnako/domain-driven-design-using-naked-objects>`_ by Dan Haywood.
