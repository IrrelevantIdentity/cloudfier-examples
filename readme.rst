This repository contains simple examples of Cloudfier applications.

For instructions on how to get these example apps into Cloudfier,

When running these applications, it is usually possible to login as user 'guest' 
(no password), except if the application does not support anonymous login (check 
the mdd.properties file). The descriptions below include some examples of credentials
that can be used to log in.
