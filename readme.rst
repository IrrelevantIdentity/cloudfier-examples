Expenses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An employee reports expenses. Expenses occur on a date and belong to some expense category. Expenses have a memo field describing the specific expense. Expenses are initially just recorded, and must be explicitly submitted. Once submitted, an expense can be approved, denied, or sent back for review and later be resubmitted. One must be able to find:

* all expenses submitted, approved and rejected for an employee.
* all expenses for a category
* all expenses for a given period
