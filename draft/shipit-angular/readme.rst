================================================================================
Custom UI for the Cloudfier-based ShipIt app
================================================================================

This is an AngularJS UI backed by a Cloudfier-based application back-end.

* Wherever you host the client files, you will need to proxy the "/services/" URI path to http://develop.cloudfier.com/services/
* The client code relies on the generic login UI that is automatically generated for all Cloudfier apps.
